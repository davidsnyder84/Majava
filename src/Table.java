Class: Table

data:
	p1, p2, p3, p4 - four players. p1 is always east, p2 is always south, etc. 
	mWall - wall of tiles, includes the dead wall
	
	mGameType - length of game being played (single, tonpuusen, or hanchan)
	
	mRoundWind - the prevailing wind of the current round ('E' or 'S')
	mWhoseTurn - whose turn it is (1,2,3,4 corresponds to E,S,W,N)
	mReaction - will be NO_REACTION if no calls were made during a turn, will be something else otherwise
	mGameIsOver - will be true if the game is over, false if not
	mGameResult - the specific result of the game (reason for a draw game, or who won), is UNDECIDED if game is not over
	
methods:
	mutators:
 	setCardName
	setCardEffect
	setLegality
	setSerial
	setDesiredSort - set the desired sort attribute before sorting
 	
 	accessors:
 	getCardName
	getCardEffect
	getLegality
	getSerial
	getCardType - returns the card's type (ie, Villain) as a string
	
	other:
	compareTo - compares a specified attribute of one card to another (ie: name, serial, type)
	clone - clone
