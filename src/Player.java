 	getHandSize - returns hand size
	getSeatWind - return seat wind
	getPlayerNumber - returns (1,2,3,4) corresponding to (E,S,W,N)
	getKamicha, getToimen, getShimocha - returns links to the player's neighbors
	getPoints - returns how many points the player has
	
	checkRiichi - returns true if the player is in riichi status

	checkCallStatusString - returns the specific type of call the player has made, as a string
	checkDrawNeeded - returns the type of draw the player needs (normal draw, kan draw, or none)

	
	
	private:
	__discardTile - gets a player's discard choice, discards it, and returns the tile
	__askSelfForDiscard- asks a player which tile they want to discard, returns their choice
	__askDiscardHuman - asks a human player which tile they want to discard, returns their choice
	__askDiscardCom - asks a computer player which tile they want to discard, returns their choice
	
	__askSelfForReaction - asks the player how they want to react to the discarded tile
	__askReactionHuman - asks a human player how they want to react to the discarded tile
	__askReactionCom - asks a computer player how they want to react to the discarded tile
	
	__putTileInPond - adds a tile to the player's pond
	__ableToCallTile - checks if the player is able to make a call on Tile t
	
	
	other:
	addTileToHand - add a tile to the player's hand
	takeTurn - walks the player through their discard turn, returns their discard
	reactToDiscard - shows a player a discarded tile, and gets their reaction (call or no call) to it
	
	showHand - display the player's hand
	showPond - display the player's pond
	getPondAsString - get the player's pond as a string
