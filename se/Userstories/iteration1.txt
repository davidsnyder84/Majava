In this iteration, the game consists of taking turns drawing and discarding tiles. Players can call other playersâ€™ discards to make melds. The events of the game are displayed in a text interface, and player input is taken through the command line. The game ends when the wall runs out of tiles. There is no way to claim a win yet.
